# Activities-Nightscout
Convert activities recorded as "note" into ones recognized by NS and NSReporter

## Rationale
I could not find a way to properly enter activities into xDrip, and the Contour
app I used before stopped working after I upgraded my smartphone.

To properly represent activities, e.g., in NightScout Reporter, "notes" containing
`${minutes} min ${activity} [${intensity}]` must be converted.

I will still use the tag `csv2exercise` to avoid issues when switching over.
